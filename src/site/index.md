##

Locust Valley Bible Church is an average size church located at the base of a mountain in the beautiful countryside south-west of Middletown, Maryland.

We are an independent, fundamental, Bible-believing church. Our desire is to be "Holding Forth the Word of Life" (Philippians 2:16).

We invite you to explore our website and discover more about us. We wish to extend a special invitation to you to visit us at the church.
